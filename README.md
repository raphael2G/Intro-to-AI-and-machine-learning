# Intro-to-AI-and-machine-learning
This repository contains introductory code for AI and machine learning. Primarily written in python notebooks using Tensorflow and keras, these brief snippets can be utilized as a starting point for anyone looking to start creating their first AI project. Video lectures on each topic can be seen on my youtube channel [coming soon].


# Chapter 1 - Handwritten Digit Classifier with MNIST dataset
In this chapter, we learn to download a dataset using tensorflow datasets, process data, and create, train, and evaluate a feed forward multilayer perceptron for the purpose of image classification. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Tensorflow Datasets
- Introduction to data processing (via keras layers)
- Sequential model creation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

# Chapter 2 - Exploring Convolutional Neural Networks with Image Classification
In this chapter, we look to explore Convolutional Neural Networks: what they are, how they work, and why they're 
better than our previous image classification approaches. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- Creating your own datasets
- Utilizing Duck Duck Go API
- Augmenting data to improve model performance
- Uploading our own images to our model

# Chapter 3 - Who survives the titanic?
In this chapter, we learn to create a  model to predict survivors on the titanic. We'll load a premade dataset, learn to analyze trends, manipulate data, and train a multilayer perceptron neural network. 

Main points covered: 
- Loading CSV data
- Visualizing trends using pandas
- Creating and training a neural network 

# Chapter 4 - Another convolutional neural network...
In this chapter, we'll take our CNN but create our own custom training loop for it. Here, we'll learn about what really goes on when you train a model. 

Main points covered:
- Loss functions
- Gradient descent
- Back propogation
- Optimizers

# Chapter 5 - Optimizing our models
In this chapter, we're taking on hyperparameters. Here, we'll cover differerent hyperparameters, there effects, and a basic way of optimizing these for model performance. 

Main points covered: 
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Overfitting
- Convergence


# Chapter   - Utilizing CNNs for Reinforcement Learning
We've learned about training models, CNNs, and generating data. Now, we can combine everything to create a model that can play videogames through Reinforcement Learning. We'll be utilizing Deep Q Algorithms to create a program to play snake. 

Main points covered: 
- Reading and understanding research papers
- Creating your own customized training loops
- Creating DQN agents
- Creating custom loss functions
