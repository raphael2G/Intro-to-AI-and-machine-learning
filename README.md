# Intro-to-AI-and-machine-learning
This repository contains introductory code for AI and machine learning. Primarily written in python notebooks using Tensorflow and keras, these brief snippets can be utilized as a starting point for anyone looking to start creating their first AI project. Video lectures on each topic can be seen on my youtube channel [coming soon].


# Chapter 1 - Handwritten Digit Classifier with MNIST dataset
In this chapter, we learn to download a dataset using tensorflow datasets, process data, and create, train, and evaluate a feed forward multilayer perceptron for the purpose of image classification.
