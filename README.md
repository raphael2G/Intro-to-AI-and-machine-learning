# Intro-to-AI-and-machine-learning
This repository contains introductory code for AI and machine learning. Primarily written in python notebooks using Tensorflow and keras, these brief snippets can be utilized as a starting point for anyone looking to start creating their first AI project. Video lectures on each topic can be seen on my youtube channel [coming soon].

### What will you learn
The purpose of this book is to take anyone interested in artificial intelligence from complete begginer to having the ability to...
1. Learn more complicated AI (and non AI) topics on their own
2. Turn their own projects and ideas into reality

### Time Line
The written portion of the book will be completed by June 30th, 2023. All associated videos will be posted by July 31st, 2023. 

Updates to the github now have to go through finalization process as I continue to write this book. People will utilize this as a resource to learn, and the last thing I want to do is confuse anyone along their journey while materials are undergoing development. If you would like to help, let me know.

# Table of Contents

## Chapter 1 - Handwritten Digit Classifier with MNIST dataset
In this chapter, we learn to download a dataset using tensorflow datasets, process data, and create, train, and evaluate a feed forward multilayer perceptron for the purpose of image classification. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Tensorflow Datasets
- Introduction to data processing (via keras layers)
- Sequential model creation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Chapter 2 - Exploring Convolutional Neural Networks with Image Classification
In this chapter, we look to explore Convolutional Neural Networks: what they are, how they work, and why they're 
better than our previous image classification approaches. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- Creating your own datasets
- Utilizing Duck Duck Go API
- Augmenting data to improve model performance
- Uploading our own images to our model

## Chapter 3 - Who survives the titanic?
In this chapter, we learn to create a  model to predict survivors on the titanic. We'll load a premade dataset, learn to analyze trends, manipulate data, and train a multilayer perceptron neural network. 

Main points covered: 
- Loading CSV data
- Visualizing trends using pandas
- Creating and training a neural network 

## Chapter 4 - Another convolutional neural network...
In this chapter, we'll take our CNN but create our own custom training loop for it. Here, we'll learn about what really goes on when you train a model. 

Main points covered:
- Loss functions
- Gradient descent
- Back propogation
- Optimizers

## Chapter ?? - Optimizing our models
In this chapter, we're taking on hyperparameters. Here, we'll cover differerent hyperparameters, there effects, and a basic way of optimizing these for model performance. 

Main points covered: 
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Overfitting
- Convergence

## Chapter ?? - That's neat! Introduction to genetic algorithm
In this chapter, we'll experiment with a simple genetic algorithm to implement our first reinforcement learning model to play google's dinosaur game (chrome://dino/). 

Main points covered:
- Reinforcement Learning
- NEAT algorithm
- Loss

## Chapter ?? - Welcome to the gym
In this chapter, we'll be playing around in Open AI's gym to land a lunar lander on the moon utilizing a simple reinforcement learning algorithm.

Main points covered:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Open AI gym
- Markov decision process

## Chapter ?? - Utilizing CNNs for Reinforcement Learning
We've learned about training models, CNNs, and generating data. Now, we can combine everything to create a model that can play videogames through Reinforcement Learning. We'll be utilizing Deep Q Algorithms to create a program to play snake. 

Main points covered: 
- Reading and understanding research papers
- Creating your own customized training loops
- Creating DQN agents
- Creating custom loss functions

## Chapter ?? - Off the grid
If you've done everything, you should feel confident in your AI ability to create your own project ... or maybe you don't. Either way, if you've made these projects you will absolutely have the skill set to create your own project. It probably won't be amazing, or super cool ... but it'll be your own project. The more you practice, the better you'll get. Here, we'll discuss how to take the idea of a project and break it down into small, approachable pieces that can be put together to make your idea a reality. 

Main points covered: 
- Coming up with project idea
- Breaking project up into approachable tasks
- Methods for organization
- Techniques for consistency
