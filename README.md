# Intro-to-AI-and-machine-learning
This repository contains introductory code for AI and machine learning. Primarily written in python notebooks using Tensorflow and keras, these brief snippets can be utilized as a starting point for anyone looking to start creating their first AI project. Video lectures on each topic can be seen on my youtube channel [coming soon].
