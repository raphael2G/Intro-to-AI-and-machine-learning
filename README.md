# Intro-to-AI-and-machine-learning
This repository contains introductory code for AI and machine learning. Primarily written in python notebooks using Tensorflow and keras, these brief snippets can be utilized as a starting point for anyone looking to start creating their first AI project. Video lectures on each topic can be seen on my youtube channel [coming soon].


# Chapter 1 - Handwritten Digit Classifier with MNIST dataset
In this chapter, we learn to download a dataset using tensorflow datasets, process data, and create, train, and evaluate a feed forward multilayer perceptron for the purpose of image classification. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Tensorflow Datasets
- Introduction to data processing (via keras layers)
- Sequential model creation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

# Chapter 2 - Exploring Convolutional Neural Networks with Image Classification
In this chapter, we look to explore Convolutional Neural Networks: what they are, how they work, and why they're 
better than our previous image classification approaches. 

Main points covered: 
- Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- Creating your own datasets
- Utilizing Duck Duck Go API
- Augmenting data to improve model performance
- Uploading our own images to our model

# Chapter 3 - Utilizing CNNs for Reinforcement Learning
We've learned about training models, CNNs, and generating data. Now, we can combine everything to create a model that can play videogames through Reinforcement Learning. We'll be utilizing Deep Q Algorithms to create a program to play snake.
